This is an [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest) data source for [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/). The STAC specification provides a common metadata specification, API, and catalog format to describe geospatial assets, so they can more easily indexed and discovered. A 'spatiotemporal asset' is any file that represents information about the earth captured in a certain space and time.

Intake-STAC provides an opinionated way for users to load Assets from STAC catalogs into the scientific Python ecosystem. It uses the [intake-xarray](https://github.com/intake/intake-xarray) plugin and supports several file formats including GeoTIFF, netCDF, GRIB, and OpenDAP.

## Installation

Intake-STAC has a few [requirements](requirements.txt), such as [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io), [intake-xarray](https://intake-xarray.readthedocs.io/) and [pystac](https://github.com/stac-utils/pystac). Intake-stac can be installed in any of the following ways:

cat['Houston-East-20170831-103f-100d-0f4f-RGB'].metadata
da = cat['Houston-East-20170831-103f-100d-0f4f-RGB']['thumbnail'].to_dask()
