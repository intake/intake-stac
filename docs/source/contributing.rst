Feature requests and feedback
-----------------------------

Do you like intake-stac?  Share some love on Twitter or in your blog posts!

We'd also like to hear about your propositions and suggestions.  Feel free to
`submit them as issues <https://github.com/intake/intake-stac>`_ and:

* Explain in detail how they should work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.  This will make it easier to implement.


.. _reportbugs:

Report bugs
-----------

Report bugs for intake-stac in the `issue tracker <https://github.com/intake/intake-stac>`_.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting,
  specifically the Python interpreter version, installed libraries, and intake-stac
  version.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

If you can write a demonstration test that currently fails but should pass
(xfail), that is a very useful commit to make as well, even if you cannot
fix the bug itself.


.. _fixbugs:

Fix bugs
--------

Look through the `GitHub issues for bugs <https://github.com/intake/intake-stac/labels/type:%20bug>`_.

Talk to developers to find out how you can fix specific bugs.


Write documentation
-------------------

intake-stac could always use more documentation.  What exactly is needed?

* More complementary documentation.  Have you perhaps found something unclear?
* Docstrings.  There can never be too many of them.
* Blog posts, articles and such -- they're all very appreciated.

You can also edit documentation files directly in the GitHub web interface,
without using a local copy.  This can be convenient for small fixes.

.. note::
    Build the documentation locally with the following command:

    .. code:: bash

        $ conda env create -f ci/environment-dev.yml
        $ cd docs
        $ make html

    The built documentation should be available in the ``docs/_build/``.

Preparing Pull Requests
-----------------------


#. Fork the
   `intake-stac GitHub repository <https://github.com/intake/intake-stac>`__.  It's
   fine to use ``intake-stac`` as your fork repository name because it will live
   under your user.


#. Clone your fork locally using `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and create a branch::

    $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/intake-stac.git
    $ cd intake-stac

    # now, to fix a bug or add feature create your own branch off "master":

    $ git checkout -b your-bugfix-feature-branch-name master


#. Install development version in a conda environment::

    $ conda env create -f ci/environment-dev.yml
    $ conda activate intake-stac-dev
    $ pip install . -e


#. Install `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com>`_ and its hook on the intake-stac repo::

     $ pip install --user pre-commit
     $ pre-commit install

   Afterwards ``pre-commit`` will run whenever you commit.

   https://pre-commit.com/ is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks
   to ensure code-style and code formatting is consistent.


#. Run all the tests

   Now running tests is as simple as issuing this command::

    $ pytest --junitxml=test-reports/junit.xml --cov=./ --verbose


   This command will run tests via the "pytest" tool against Python 3.7.


#. You can now edit your local working copy and run the tests again as necessary. Please follow PEP-8 for naming.

   When committing, ``pre-commit`` will re-format the files if necessary.


#. Commit and push once your tests pass and you are happy with your change(s)::

    $ git commit -a -m "<commit message>"
    $ git push -u


#. Finally, submit a pull request through the GitHub website using this data::

    head-fork: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/intake-stac
    compare: your-branch-name

    base-fork: intake/intake-stac
    base: master
